# Ex8_Movie_recommender_and_anomaly_detection

This programming exercise was done as part of Coursera's Machine Learning Course (Stanford University), taught by Prof. Andrew Ng.

## Detect failing servers on a network (Anomaly Detection)

* Implemented the anomaly detection algorithm and applied it to detect anomalous behavior on server computers on a dataset where each example has 11 features capturing the properties of computer servers
* Fitted a Gaussian distribution model to the data, implemented an algorithm to select the best threshold based on the F1 score of the cross validation set 
* Detected anomalies based on the threshold 

## Movie Recommender System

* Used the collaborative filtering algorithm  to build a recommender system for movies using a datset of movie ratings.
* Computed regularized collaborative filtering cost and gradient, used Octave's fmincg optimization solver to learn the parameters of the model
* Used the model to generate movie recommendations
